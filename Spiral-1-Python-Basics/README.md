# 📘 Spiral 1 – Python Basics

This folder contains my first spiral of learning in the 12-Spiral Data Science Journey.  
In Spiral 1, I focused on building a strong base in Python and worked on the Netflix dataset.

## 📅 Day 1 Notebooks:
- `Spiral-1-Day-1-Python.ipynb` → Python theory (print, variables)
- `Spiral-1-Day-1-Netflix.ipynb` → Netflix dataset practice using Python basics

## 🎯 Spiral Goal:
To build a strong foundation in Python through structured spirals — first theory, then real-world dataset practice.

## 📚 Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Netflix Dataset (CSV)

## 📅 Day 2 Summary

### 🧠 Topics Covered:
- if-else statements
- for and while loops
- functions with return and default arguments
- list operations (append, loop)
- Netflix dataset filtering and value counts
