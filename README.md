# 🌀 12-Spiral Data Science Journey

Welcome to my structured **12-Spiral Learning Journey** where I’m mastering **Data Science and AI** step-by-step.

This repository tracks my daily learning using a unique system called the **Spiral Method** — where I revisit key topics again and again, going deeper each time. This makes my learning strong, layered, and long-lasting.

## 📌 What is the Spiral Method?

Instead of trying to learn everything at once, I’m using a spiral method:

- Each spiral = one complete cycle (Python → Libraries → Mini Project)
- Every next spiral revisits the same concepts with **more depth**
- Helps me understand better and build **real skills over time**

## 🎯 My Main Goals

- ✅ Become a confident **Data Scientist** in 3 months  
- ✅ Build a **portfolio for freelancing & job applications**  
- ✅ Master Python, Pandas, EDA, Machine Learning, and AI  
- ✅ Share my journey and help others learn
